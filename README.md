# ProducerConsumerFramework
A basic producer consumer framework for .NET Core

The code in this project provides a basic framework to quickly set up a pipeline of producer consumer blocks.
The main inspiration behind the code was the need to build a stability testing tool that can track crashes and other situations when testing an application
over a large set of documents. A few things to note:
* This is just a starting point. I'm certain that there are many improvements possible on this code.
* The code attempts to provide a generic wrapper that implements queuing and synchronization when multiple processing blocks are chained together.


**Coming soon...**
Example for usage of this code.
